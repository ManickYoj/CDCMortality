            <p>
              Each year, the CDC publishes a dataset of deaths from that year.
              Approximately 2.5 million people die in the US each year and each one
              gets a row in the dataset with a slew of demographic data. Below , I
              have grouped all deaths from 2003, 2008, and 2013 by their highest
              educational attainment. The vertical axis represents the average
              age of death for each group. From this data, a question arises:
              Why do 8th grade graduates live longer than their more educated
              fellows? Note: Those who died with no formal education are
              excluded because they have a drastically lower average life expectancy
              due to those who die from infant-specific diseases.
